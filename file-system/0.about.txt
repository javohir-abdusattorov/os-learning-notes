Requirements for long-term information storage:
* It must be possible to store a very large amount of information
* Information must survive the termination of the process using it
* Multiple processes must be able to access the information at once

Disk - linear sequence of fixed-size blcocks, supporting 2 operations: read block K, write block K

Files - logical units of information created by processes. We can think of file as a kind of address space. Information stored in files must be persistent - not be affected by process creation and termination.

File system - part of the OS dealing with files. Determines how files are structured, named, accessed, used, protected, implmeented, and managed
